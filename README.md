# Personal configurations for \*nix like environment

## Background
Consolidating all of my dotfiles in a single repository.

## GNU Nano
[GNU nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) was my go-to text editor once I started
using \*nix like environments as it was easy to use and was supplied by many 
Distros and embedded platforms. I did not want to invest much time to learn VIM 
and/or emacs at that point. At the beginning of 2017, I needed a powerful, 
highly configurable text editor. Vim was the most obvious choice recommended 
by many friends[(1)](http://amirsamimi.ir/vim/). I barely use nano these days. 
I still love it so much. I keep the config file in honor of my good old memories
of using it.

## VIM
[Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) is a popular free and 
open source multi-purpose text editor. This repository contains my personal 
[vimrc](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Open_vimrc_file) config file. It was created 
as the *default vimrc Example* which was suggested in
[vimtutor](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Tutorial) and was shipped with my Vim 
installation.

## Installation
**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, review them and remove
and/or change items you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use settings unless
you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!
