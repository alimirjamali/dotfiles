# Ali’s dotfiles

## About

Consolidating all of my dotfiles in a single repository.

## Installation

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove/change things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

### Using Git

Simply clone/download the repository and create hardlinks to the desired dotfile.
